<h1>Paragraph</h1>
<p>Before you can begin to determine what the composition<br/> of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide on an <br/>argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. <br/>What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader?<br/> The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea.<br/> In other words, your paragraphs should remind your <br/>reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and<br/> the information in each paragraph.<br/> A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper,<br/> and your ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic <br/>one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-<br/>blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between<br/> all of the ideas in the paper<br/>.

The decision about what to put into your paragraphs <br/>begins with the germination of a seed of ideas; <br/>this “germination process” is better known as brainstorming.<br/> There are many techniques for brainstorming;<br/> whichever one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped. <br/>Building paragraphs can be like building a skyscraper: <br/>there must be a well-planned foundation that supports what<br/> you are building. Any cracks, inconsistencies, or other<br/> corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper to crumble.</p>
