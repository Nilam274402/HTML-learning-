What is a paragraph? 
Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:
 a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the
 unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
